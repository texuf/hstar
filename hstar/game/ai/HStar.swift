/**
 HStar is a modified AStar algorithm that is familiar with the rules of Hedgehog Escape
 it also dirtly uses globals from the model.swift file
 based of the classic A* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm
 
 returns 
    empty array if no path was found
    array of count 1 if start is equal to the goal
    array of hedges describing the position and orientation of each move required to reach target
 
 throws 
    invalidOrientation
 
 caveats
    - since the hedge is symetrical, each unique combination of lower left tile 
        and shape maps to two hedge positions, which can cause some inefficiencies in this
        algorithm, but because it's always taking the shortest path, loops shouldn't be returned in the answer
